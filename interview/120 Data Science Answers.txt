PREDICTIVE MODELING (19 QUESTIONS)

If asked to predict a response variable during your interview, you should favor simpler models that run quickly and which you can easily explain. If the task is specifically a predictive modeling task, you should try to do, or at least mention, cross-validation as it really is the golden standard to evaluate the quality of one’s model. Talk about and justify your approach while you’re doing it, and leave some time to plot and visualize the data.


1 (Given a Dataset) Analyze this dataset and give me a model that can predict this response variable.

Answer: Classification or Regression, go through the data analysis pipeline


2 What could be some issues if the distribution of the test data is significantly different than the distribution of the training data?

Answer: Basically, you are going to make bad predictions because of covariate shift. Use logistic regression for covariate shift correction. Weight the training data according to the difference in density between the training set and the test set. Get the weighting by using logistic regression.


3 What are some ways I can make my model more robust to outliers?

Answer: If the data come from a known distribution (e.g., Gaussian), then we can define the shape of the data, where outlying observations are far from the fit shape. For example, a robust covariance estimate can fit an ellipse to the central data points, ignoring points outside the central mode. Assuming that the inlier data are Gaussian distributed, it will estimate the inlier location and covariance in a robust way (i.e. without being influenced by outliers). The Mahalanobis distances obtained from this estimate are used to derive a measure of outlyingness.


4 What are some differences you would expect in a model that minimizes squared error, versus a model that minimizes absolute error? In which cases would each error metric be appropriate?

Answer: Minimizing the sum of absolute errors gives you an estimate of the conditional median, whereas minimizing sum of squared errors gives you a conditional mean.


5 What error metric would you use to evaluate how good a binary classifier is? What if the classes are imbalanced? What if there are more than 2 groups?

Answer: ROC Curve (False positive rate vs. True positive rate), Precision-Recall Curves for evaluating a binary classifier; For imbalanced classes, use rates instead of absolute numbers, for example True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR); Confusion matrices for more than 2 groups


6 What are various ways to predict a binary response variable? Can you compare two of them and tell me when one would be more appropriate? What’s the difference between these? (SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, etc.)

Answer:

Advantages of Naive Bayes: Super simple, you're just doing a bunch of counts. If the NB conditional independence assumption actually holds, a Naive Bayes classifier will converge quicker than discriminative models like logistic regression, so you need less training data. And even if the NB assumption doesn't hold, a NB classifier still often performs surprisingly well in practice. A good bet if you want to do some kind of semi-supervised learning, or want something embarrassingly simple that performs pretty well.

Advantages of Logistic Regression: Lots of ways to regularize your model, and you don't have to worry as much about your features being correlated, like you do in Naive Bayes. You also have a nice probabilistic interpretation, unlike decision trees or SVMs, and you can easily update your model to take in new data (using an online gradient descent method), again unlike decision trees or SVMs. Use it if you want a probabilistic framework (e.g., to easily adjust classification thresholds, to say when you're unsure, or to get confidence intervals) or if you expect to receive more training data in the future that you want to be able to quickly incorporate into your model.

Advantages of Decision Trees: Easy to interpret and explain (for some people -- I'm not sure I fall into this camp). Non-parametric, so you don't have to worry about outliers or whether the data is linearly separable (e.g., decision trees easily take care of cases where you have class A at the low end of some feature x, class B in the mid-range of feature x, and A again at the high end). Their main disadvantage is that they easily overfit, but that's where ensemble methods like random forests (or boosted trees) come in. Plus, random forests are often the winner for lots of problems in classification (usually slightly ahead of SVMs, I believe), they're fast and scalable, and you don't have to worry about tuning a bunch of parameters like you do with SVMs, so they seem to be quite popular these days.

Advantages of SVMs: High accuracy, nice theoretical guarantees regarding overfitting, and with an appropriate kernel they can work well even if your data isn't linearly separable in the base feature space. Especially popular in text classification problems where very high-dimensional spaces are the norm. Memory-intensive and kind of annoying to run and tune, though, so I think random forests are starting to steal the crown.

To go back to the particular question of logistic regression vs. decision trees (which I'll assume to be a question of logistic regression vs. random forests) and summarize a bit: both are fast and scalable, random forests tend to beat out logistic regression in terms of accuracy, but logistic regression can be updated online and gives you useful probabilities. And since you're at Square (not quite sure what an inference scientist is, other than the embodiment of fun) and possibly working on fraud detection: having probabilities associated to each classification might be useful if you want to quickly adjust thresholds to change false positive/false negative rates, and regardless of the algorithm you choose, if your classes are heavily imbalanced (as often happens with fraud), you should probably resample the classes or adjust your error metrics to make the classes more equal.


7 What is regularization and where might it be helpful? What is an example of using regularization in a model?

Answer: According to Wikipedia, regularization "refers to a process of introducing additional information in order to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting. This information is usually of the form of a penalty for complexity, such as restrictions for smoothness or bounds on the vector space norm."


8 Why might it be preferable to include fewer predictors over many?

Answer: Prevent overfitting by generalizing to more cases


9 Given training data on tweets and their retweets, how would you predict the number of retweets of a given tweet after 7 days after only observing 2 days worth of data?

Answer: I would try a combination of methods: a simulation involving a Poisson model based on tweet arrival data, but also a generalized linear model to see if regression works

PROGRAMMING (14 QUESTIONS)

Traditional software engineering questions may show up in data science interviews. Expect those questions to be easier, less about systems, and more about your ability to manipulate data, read databases, and do simple programming tasks. Review your SQL and prepare to do common operations such as JOIN, GROUP BY, and COUNT. Review ways to manipulate data and strings (we suggest doing this in Python), so you can answer questions that involve sifting through numerical or string data.

PROBABILITY (19 QUESTIONS)

Many Bayes’ Rule questions can be solved quickly with the odds form of Bayes Rule, which says that prior odds times likelihood ratio is the posterior odds. For problem 18, the prior odds is 1:1 and the likelihood ratio is 1/4:9/16, so the posterior odds is 4:9. For problem 19, the prior odds is 999:1 and the likelihood ratio is 1/1024:1 (10 heads has a 1/1024 probability with a fair coin and a 1 probability with a biased coin), which means the posterior odds is about 1:1.


1 Bobo the amoeba has a 25%, 25%, and 50% chance of producing 0, 1, or 2 offspring, respectively. Each of Bobo’s descendants also have the same probabilities. What is the probability that Bobo’s lineage dies out?

Answer: 

3 How can you generate a random number between 1 - 7 with only a die?

Answer: Create a function that simulates a die, returning a random number between 1 and 6. Since getting the number 7 will require two rolls of the die, which means 6 times 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Then, we just get the remainder of the total divided by 7 to assign the number between 1 and 7.

4 How can you get a fair coin toss if someone hands you a coin that is weighted to come up heads more often than tails?

Answer: Toss the coin twice. If HH or TT shows up, ignore the result. If HT, then select heads. If TH, select tails. The bias is removed because the latter two results have equal probabilities.

5 You have an 50-50 mixture of two normal distributions with the same standard deviation. How far apart do the means need to be in order for this distribution to be bimodal?

Answer: A mixture of two normal distributions with equal standard deviations is bimodal only if their means differ by at least twice the common standard deviation.

6 Given draws from a normal distribution with known parameters, how can you simulate draws from a uniform distribution?

Answer: 

7 A certain couple tells you that they have two children, at least one of which is a girl. What is the probability that they have two girls?

15 Let’s say you have a very tall father. On average, what would you expect the height of his son to be? Taller, equal, or shorter? What if you had a very short father?

Answer: The height of the son will probably be shorter for a very tall father, and the height of the son will probably be taller for a very short father. This is known as regression to the mean.

16 What’s the expected number of coin flips until you get two heads in a row? What’s the expected number of coin flips until you get two tails in a row?

Answer: e = (1/2)*(e+1) + (1/4)*(e+2) + (1/8)*(2) = 5

17 Let’s say we play a game where I keep flipping a coin until I get heads. If the first time I get heads is on the nth coin, then I pay you 2n-1 dollars. How much would you pay me to play this game?

Answer:

18 You have two coins, one of which is fair and comes up heads with a probability 1/2, and the other which is biased and comes up heads with probability 3/4. You randomly pick a coin and flip it twice, and get heads both times. What is the probability that you picked the fair coin?

Answer: The prior odds is 1:1 and the likelihood ratio is 1/4:9/16, so the posterior odds is 4:9.

19 You have a 0.1% chance of picking up a coin with both heads, and a 99.9% chance that you pick up a fair coin. You flip your coin and it comes up heads 10 times. What’s the chance that you picked up the fair coin, given the information that you observed?

Answer: The prior odds is 999:1 and the likelihood ratio is 1/1024:1 (10 heads has a 1/1024 probability with a fair coin and a 1 probability with a biased coin), which means the posterior odds is about 1:1.




STATISTICAL INFERENCE (15 QUESTIONS)
